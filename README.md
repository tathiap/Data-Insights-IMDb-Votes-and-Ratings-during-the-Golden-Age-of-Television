# Data Insights: IMDb Votes and Ratings during the Golden Age of Television

###### Project Objective:

The primary goal of the "Basic Python: Project" is to investigate the relationship between the number of votes received by TV shows on IMDb and their ratings during the "Golden Age" of television. The project aims to determine whether highly-rated TV shows, particularly those released during this period, also exhibit a higher number of votes. Through data analysis, the objective is to assess and validate the assumption that viewer engagement, as measured by the number of votes, corresponds with the perceived quality of TV shows during this influential era in television history. This project aligns with the practical challenges faced by data professionals, emphasizing the importance of validating initial assumptions to inform informed decision-making in the entertainment industry.
